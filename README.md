This website is a platform that allows individuals to participate in social activities and earn social credits, which they can then sell to companies looking to fulfill their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals. The social credits are earned by participating in activities that promote social impact in various areas such as education, health, hunger, environment, and more. The website verifies user participation in these activities and awards the appropriate amount of social credits. Later organizations can buy these credits from users in exchange of crypto currency (MATIC). By participating in this platform, individuals can make a positive impact on their communities while companies can fulfill their CSR goals in a transparent and meaningful way.
